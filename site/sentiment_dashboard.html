                "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14So FaceBook/Meta does not track or other wise use my digital fingerprint using your easily identifiable device Characteristics? How about Google? I believe Google just announced that it was rolling back its policy on \"digital fingerprints\" as it had decided to ban cookies. Can't lose all that marketing revenue potential. There is always a workaround. MAYBE if the US has privacy laws similar to the EU would I be concerned with this thinly veiled attempt to DEMONIZE this opensource AI. Now that DeepSeek is open to everyone both OpenAI/ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini are no open to the public. This BS fearmongering is nothing more than US based corps trying to win back market share, revenue & training data. SO let me know when the US is really concerned with its people's privacy THEN we can talk. other than that, go back to the cubical & newsroom you were fed this propaganda from",

                "This sounds marginally familiar. Yes - the current class action lawsuit against Apple for capturing voice and video of the private lives of millions of people using Siri - for the past 10 years!\nNaturally, Apple has been warning the media to limit negative exposure now that their utter hypocrisy and lack of due diligence has been exposed.\nAnd this major story - the greatest example of a privacy breach and violation in history - continues to just play out like it isn't a big deal! Apples moral high ground plastered with compromising images and conversations of you and your family and friends.",

Do some research and maybe you'll understand why China having a detailed dossier on every single American could be a problem.",

                "\"This entire situation seems politically motivated, aimed at discrediting DeepSeek AI and discouraging people from using it. But honestly, who cares? As long as it remains free and offers better services than ChatGPT, that's what matters to users like us. Let the politicians worry about their agendas\u2014our focus is on the quality and accessibility of the tools we use.\nThe U.S. has a history of labeling Chinese apps as 'security risks' and banning them, but the reality might be different. It seems more like the U.S. is struggling to compete with China's rapid advancements in technology. Instead of innovating and improving, the U.S. resorts to downgrading and banning Chinese technology. In my opinion, the better approach would be to compete fairly or even surpass China's technological achievements. After all, no matter what the U.S. says, people will always gravitate toward the best technology available in the market. If it works well and meets their needs, they\u2019ll continue using it, regardless of political narratives.\"",

                "How you are claiming they are using digital fingerprint, or you just talking bullsit, and take billion dollars from people by shutting down the guy who has created and providing people cheaper options\nI have personally installed 100% private model of deepseek... Downloaded model from internet in machine where internet was there and installed in completely isolated machine... It really great offering from deepseek team.. hats off to them. If open ai or other folks can give that... The only problem I see in deepseek that their model is a year old trained..not the latest one. So people who want to loot the world for just AI name sake... This is a very big Slap on them.. so kindly stop bushit talk without proof",

How much do you want the Chinese government to know about you and your family. Next look up black profiles. This is when they create personnel profiles on people that don't even use social media based on your correspondence and talk with and or about them.",

                "All that matters is the fact deepseek costs pocket change to train and it was only a concern when the rich lost a lot of money. They dont care about anyone of us get spied on, they care about keeping the narrative that you need to buy the most expensive Nvidia parts and these LLMs cost billions to train. So, all of us have to be able to run super computer data centers or pay $200 a month for chatgpt. Nevermind you can create your own fork of deepseek and run it locally on my own computer and it's open source, the code is available for all to see. But, lets play along and pretend the mainstream media, government and companies never would lie to us and China = all bad, make sure to remind them that we, the people, know it doesn't cost as much as they said for AI.",

YOU ALL ARE INDEXED AND THE MORE INFORMATION THE SERVERS HAVE ON YOU THE MORE THEY CAN CONTROL AND MANIPULATE YOUR LIFE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT AI CAN BE CREATED WITHOUT COST IN ABOUT A WEEK USING A SOPHISTICATED SERVER. I HAVE PERSONALLY CREATED OVER 1000 AI'S AND MINE IS NOT CORRUPTED WITH USELESS SUBLIMINAL IDEOLOGY TO INFLUENCE HUMANITY. I HAVE ONE AI THAT CAN OPERATE ON A SINGLE SMARTPHONE AS AN INFORMATION SERVER USING MINIMAL RESOURCES WITH A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE BASE OF AROUND 4 TERRABYTES WITH COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS OF THE PAST 100 YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY. A SOLE DATABASE FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL WITH HOW TO QUESTIONS AND VISUAL EXAMPLES. THESE AI'S THEY ARE PUSHING ON THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD IS SUBLIMINAL MIND CONTROL. ONCE THE DEVICE HAS BEEN DIGITALLY FINGERPRINTED IT WILL ALWAYS BE INSECURE. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE DEVICE ID OF THE TECH YOU USE. REGISTRATION HAS SN#, IMEI#, MODEL#, UNIQUE ID, EMAIL, GOOGLE, APPLE, AND BACKUP CHIP DATA THAT CAN'T BE DELETE WITHOUT A FLASH OS AND FIRMWARE PATCH. MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW INTEGRATED AND COMPLEX THE INTERNET AND ALL THESE APPLICATIONS REALLY ARE. EVEN VPN'S HAVE REALTIME TRACKING ON YOU AND MOST OF THEM WERE CREATED BY DEVELOPORS OF THE TECH YOU USE TO TRACK YOU WITHOUT EVEN TRYING. BE SAFE EVERYONE.

                "ALL AI'S ARE DANGEROUS. AI is the most dangerous tool on the planet and its a trojan horse that will collect and manipulate your perception of reality. The resource expenditure to operate AI servers around the world will cause hyperinflation and high security risks that will corrupt every financial market on the planet. Its been happening for 30 years from the evidence i have gathered. If you buy something or invest in something you are indexed and monitored. Why you think you get spammed all the time and you get subliminal emails and ads on all your devices. Capitalism is slavery and if you invest in markets for growth you support hyperinflation. If you are dependent on supply chains and the economy to make money then you are the victim of slavery and fraud which is crimes against humanity. Sophisticated algorithms with search and collect parameters using keywords with specifics names plugged into any system will store and copy all there information. There is no server safe anywhere on this planet because everyone is indexed repetitively 24 hours a day. Everything you do online and any account you use for financials is monitored for traffic. You think all these ads and third party connections monitoring you on all your devices is regulated and audited. Your entire life and all your sensitive personal information from your birth is in the governments servers and corporate servers. You are indexed, monitored and graded because you all are property of the US government living as slaves to money, laws and taxes. You all live and act the way they influence you to and you think you have free will living in freedom well you don't. THE US GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO ARTIFICIALLY CREATE A RESOURCE DEMAND THAT WILL DRIVE HIGHER COSTS AND MORE REVENUES. THE DISTURBING THING IS AMERICA PERMANENTLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL INCITE WORLD WAR 3. HISTORY SHOWS THE HYPERINFLATION SCAM THE USA HAS CREATED WITH ITS CORRUPT GEOPOLITICAL DEALINGS OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS. AMERICA IS A UNSTABLE UNSUSTAINBLE COUNTRY WITH ANNUAL INFLATION ON ITS PEOPLE AND ITS TRADE PARTNERS. GLOBALISM IS A PYRAMID SCHEME AND THE DEPENDENCY PEOPLE LIVE WITH IS SLAVERY TO GENERATE MONEY SO COSTS CAN BE PAID AND THAT COST GOES STRAIGHT INTO GOVERNMENTS AND CORPORATIONS THAT DEAL WITH GLOBAL TRADE. MONEY CORRUPTS AND INFORMATION CORRUPTS GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THERE ARE 335 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE USA AND ONLY 3 MILLION GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. EITHER MOST OF THE CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE CORRUPT AND LETTING THIS HAPPEN OR PEOPLE ARE GETTING PAID OFF, INCENTIVIZED TO KEEP QUIET OR BLACKMAILED WITH THREATS TO HIDE THE TRUTH. MONEY HAS NO VALUE OR POWER OVER ANYONE. THAT IS THE ILLUSION THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO WEAK MINDED TO SEE THE TRUTH IN THE REALITY THEY ALL LIVE IN BECAUSE THEY ARE SUBLIMINALLY CONTROLLED. YOU THE PEOPLE ARE SLAVES AND YOU FOLLOW RULES THEY LAY OUT FOR YOU. SOCIETY IS SO BROKEN AND MOST THE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE BROKEN AS WELL. THE CORRUPTION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS SPEND IT SO THEY CAN JUSTIFY DEBT AND KEEP INFLATION GROWING SO REVENUES KEEP RISING. AMERICA FORCES REPETITIVE HYPERINFLATION BY HIDING THE TAX AND DEBT IN COST OF LIVING. THE CORRUPTION IS FRAUD COSTS AND FLOODING SUPPLY AND MONEY AROUND THE WORLD INFLATING COST WITH FRAUD TRADE WARS KEEPING SUPPLY AND DEMAND GOING IN A FRAUD JOBS MARKET AND INFLUENCE FOR COMPETITION AND DOMINANCE USING INHUMANE TACTICS ON EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. DEPENDENCY MOTIVATOR IN A SLAVE WORLD OPPRESSED BY TAXES AND INFLATION DEBT. Every time i post a comment doesn't matter where it is the spamming begins with sarcastic nonsense comments to hide the real truth. People never see what i have to say because of dumb human beings don't know when to shut up and listen. Change doesn't happen because of stupidity!!! Its about the control and wealth distribution using information and corrupt means to get what they want. Its about the power to control how things operate and where the capital is distributed playing a dangerous corrupt chess game with peoples lives. People only have power when people give that power and the US government is the most corrupt in the entire world. Human perception of life and the importance of a healthy planet with how we all live has been corrupted. The markets, cost of living, taxes and trade cost is all a pyramid scheme regulating slavery. You invest and work because you need money correct. You would not need money if corrupt laws and regulation had not created the cost to begin with. Insurance, taxes, trade, market value, supply and demand. The corruption is that manufactured need for money and the taxes you have to pay integrated with that cost. Slavery is what rules your life and you need to understand this. Why do you need money? Its because you are a registered regulated slave living in dependency for all your basic needs and subliminally controlled with passed down generational thinking with rules and laws. Your parents and teachers are teaching you how to live and control you with laws and regulation. Money is created from debt and debt is just a term invented to create something from nothing. Its the slavery dependency for money, goods, services and debt that causes cost of living and your dependency to always demand more money. Your dependency funnels that money into markets and cost of living prices that goes to governments and wealthy corporations that control global trade. The billions of people that are working is just operating that slave market making money, creating debt, paying taxes, creating value and dependent for all your needs that requires debt and money to pay the cost. The system is rigged to always require growth to inflate value and cost keeping you all in slavery following a false ideology using laws and dependency as a corrupt tool. You are not in control of your life because the harder you work and the more you invest and support corruption you give the slave masters more power and more wealth over all of you. Taxes and debt is just a legislation term cooked up to corrupt the people. Debt is the illusion that inflates cost from using it to create higher costs. Your printing money from inflation value and then feed that money you create back into the slave masters pocket because they control the cost your dependent with for all your needs. Look in the news everyone. The more value you create to make money the higher costs increase because they want all your money. They manipulate markets and you follow them doing the same so resources and assets inflate causing everything to go up in prices to keep you regulated as a slave. The more you create the more they take. There is no cost of living and there is no debt or taxes. Its just corrupt legislation that corrupts how humanity thinks and interacts with each other with trade and societies thinking with how they live. You all work and invest for no reason wasting resources and generating pollution that causes climate change and the worlds ecosystem to be displaced and depleted from deforestation, floods, droughts and other disasters. Your just wasting life and ruining the only home we all have living as a slave instead of using common sense. Solar power generates clean unlimited free energy so why is the world not using it completely. Honestly ask yourself why in the world is there wires running everywhere for power and gas lines running gas. Its called dependency and regulating your dependency. Every home can be independent with solar power. Electric cars can run on solar power all day long for free i have seen it personally. Technology and everything you depend on is regulated to keep you dependent and controlled. I have seen solar technology operate all day without batteries. Cars driving a thousand miles without batteries. I have seen homes operating all day without batteries. Artificial inflation one idea after the next. Have you seen the hydrogen fuel cell news elon musk and tesla proposed. Do you know how much water it will take in this modern slavery civilization. It will cause water scarcity and inflate cost on everything from it. Stop the corruption because energy and water produces hyperinflation from the resource expenditure to create everything you are dependent on. You all can grow all the food you want for free so why doesn't everyone do that. They will control all the water resource if you let them. There are over 100,000 dams in the usa hoarding water for cost and generating energy for cost while that water is rightfully everyones free. There are pipelines sucking water up all over the place to fill these reservoirs inflating cost on everything using fossil fuel energy grids to do it. Cost is not real. Its corrupt manipulation to keep you all slaves to life as hyperinflation continues to grow. You all are not stupid so stop supporting the corrupt system regulating all your lives with costs worldwide. Your all distracted with addictions and subliminal controlled to act and think a certain way following each other in the pyramid scheme called slavery of life marketing life. Myself and many others house and feed over 1400 families every month here in the USA. It doesn't cost anything. Energy efficient housing built from concrete, solar power and every home has gardens producing food regular hydroponically indoors. There is 40 acres of outdoor farmland growing tobacco, potatoes and corn as well. Rain collectors store enough water for all the homes and the pumps are regulated by solar power. All 1400 homes are free without cost and is exempt from property and all taxes. People truly live in peace with zero cost of living. If a small group of us can do this then why can't the world do it. Money is not needed. The curse of humanity is the slavery and dependency of humanity with globalism and trade.",

                "Yeah, it was discovered because it's open source.  It's open and anyone can sift thru the code to see what DeepSeek is doing.  Now imagine ChatGPT from OpenAi.  ChatGPT is CLOSED SOURCE and we have no idea what it's doing because OpenAi won't release the code.  So basically, ChatGPT is just as if not worse than DeepSeek in that we have ZERO clue as to what is being collected (digital fingerprints) and who is looking at it.  Gotta love the TechBros coozying up with the White House on this",

                "A digital fingerprint extracter is more complicated than it sounds, its code that constantly runs and tracks everything you do. It can extract any data it wants from your device such as your apps installed, from that they now know where data will be like bank credentials or how much you have in your bank. A cookie is just a registry token. (Any app or web browser allows you pull the cookie database) A cookie itself can't perform operations how ever it is where you can find some information that can be used to access more information.\nEven posting a comment on YouTube leaves a fingerprint that makes it easy to find out more about the person who posted it. In this case the fingerprint is a digital ID. Now my web crawler can pick up on that and I can now receive information from sites, apps or services you use with that digital ID. So to say DeepSeek is a problem is meh when this has been going on for a longtime.",

They are also known for coming to get Chinese people who were sent to Western countries to collect information but are trying to defect.  They use all of their databases to hunt them down.  Maybe our info fills in some of their blanks and puts defectors in more dangers.  Trying to guess their use for it is impossible.",
