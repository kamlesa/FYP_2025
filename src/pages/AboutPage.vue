      <p class="text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        Emerging AI technologies are becoming increasingly integrated into everyday life across
        sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and security. While these innovations offer
        benefits in efficiency, safety, and decision-making, they also raise important questions
        about <span class="font-semibold">privacy, bias, accountability, and trust</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        Our study investigates public sentiment surrounding AI in security contexts, recognising
        that community perspectives play a vital role in shaping policy, regulation, and adoption.

        Public perception influences how AI-driven technologies are introduced and governed. By
        examining sentiment trends, our project seeks to provide insights that can guide
        <span class="font-semibold">ethical, transparent, and trustworthy deployment</span> of AI in
        Australiaâ€™s security landscape.
