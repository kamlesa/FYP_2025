        We are a two-person student team undertaking our final year project as part of our
        university studies. Our work explores how Australians perceive the use of artificial
        intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and national security.

        This project is in progress, currently the Ethics Application is not approved within our
        university, so we do not have real data, as our survey has not been distributed yet, you are
        witnessing results on fake data as we prepare for real entries!

        Emerging AI technologies are becoming increasingly integrated into everyday life across
        sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and security. While these innovations offer
        benefits in efficiency, safety, and decision-making, they also raise important questions
        about <span class="font-semibold">privacy, bias, accountability, and trust</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Our study investigates public sentiment surrounding AI in security contexts, recognising
        that community perspectives play a vital role in shaping policy, regulation, and adoption.

        Public perception influences how AI-driven technologies are introduced and governed. By
        examining sentiment trends, our project seeks to provide insights that can guide
        <span class="font-semibold">ethical, transparent, and trustworthy deployment</span> of AI in
        Australiaâ€™s security landscape.
