Public Sentiment & Ethics in AI for Law Enforcement

This Project is an extension of a separate project: AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis for Public Perception of Emerging Technologies. The previous project was discontinued, resulting in an altered scope.

We are conducting research to better understand how Australians feel about the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and national security. We have conducted an online survey, and this repository is used to showcase the results, presenting both scaled-response data and an analysis of open-ended responses.

This project is in progress, currently the Ethics Application is not approved within our university, so we do not have real data, as our survey has not been distributed yet, you are witnessing results on fake data as we prepare for real entries!
