Public Sentiment & Ethics in AI for Law Enforcement

This Project is an extension of a separate project: AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis for Public Perception of Emerging Technologies. The previous project was discontinued, resulting in an altered scope.

We are conducting research to better understand how Australians feel about the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and national security. We have conducted an online survey, and this repository is used to showcase the results, presenting both scaled-response data and an analysis of open-ended responses.

You will also be implementing a Policy Gap Identifier where we will map people's concerns to existing guidelines.
