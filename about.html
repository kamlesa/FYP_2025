      <p>
        This project is in progress, currently the Ethics Application is not
        approved within our university, so we do not have real data, as our
        survey has not been distributed yet, you are witnessing results on fake
        data as we prepare for real entries!
      </p>
      <p>
        This Project is an extension of a separate project: AI-Driven Sentiment
        Analysis for Public Perception of Emerging Technologies. The previous
        project was discontinued, resulting in an altered scope. We are
        conducting research to better understand how Australians feel about the
        use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and national
        security. We have conducted an online survey, and this repository is
        used to showcase the results, presenting both scaled-response data and
        an analysis of open-ended responses.
